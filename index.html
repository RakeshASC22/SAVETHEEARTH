        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>We are a non-profit group called Save The Earth. Our goal is to spread awareness of climate change and help people realise what a pressing issue climate change really is. At the rate we are going at, some sources estimate that the planet could be uninhabitable in as soon as 200 years. We ask everyone to step up and do their duty to help protect our planet and all the species of plants and animals that live on it. </p>

        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>Climate change is a global phenomenon which most people aren't aware of but our new device could and would change that. We would like everyone to be updated frequently on the world around them. If you didn’t know what climate change was, here’s a look at the United Nations definition for “Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.”</p>

        <h1>Our Solution</h1>
        <p class=" solutionTxt"> Our website's goal is to open people's eyes to the harsh reality of the world that we live in. Our website has a waste tracking/Carbon Footprint calculator to show people how much waste they are producing in their daily life. Using this information, we could multply it by about 300 million and we would only have the amount of waste that the United States alone creates, multiply it by 8 billion and you'll see an approximation of the total amount of waste of the human species. The sad thing is the number is monstrous and that's the amount of damage DAILY. The other feature of our website is our emailing system. Just like all news, there is constantly more and new information that comes out, and we believe that it is very important to stay on top of it all, so we created a way for all of you to stay updated, so that you are aware and prepared to fight the long battle ahead to protect our future generations.
